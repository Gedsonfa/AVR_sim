## Questions and Tasks for Lecture 1
#### Question 1-1: Nearly all source code examples use Register # 16.
Why not Register # 0?
(Hint: Change the source code of one example to use R0 instead
of R16 and try to understand the resulting error message when
assembling.)
Try to find out which types of instructions can only use R16 and
above (Use the Instruction Set Manual for 8-bit-AVRs provided by
Microchip for that).

#### Question 1-2: Which range of integer numbers can be handled
a) in 8-bits,
b) in 16 bits,
c) in 24 bits, and
d) in 32 bits.
(Hint: Under Windows use the provided calculator in the
„Programmer“ mode and switch to the Hexadecimal input
mode.)

#### Task 1-3: Find out how many registers the following CPUs
provided and at which maximum clock frequencies they ran:
a) ZUSE Z4
b) PIC8
c) 8086
d) Z80
e) 6502
Compare that with an ATtiny13 and ATtiny24 (use Microchips
Data Books for these).
